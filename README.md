# DATABASE DESCRIPTION


This folder contains the compiled data used in the article titled "Gender inequities in the online dissemination of scholars’ work" by O. Vásárhelyi, I Zakhlebin, S. Milojevic, E-Á. Horvát.


Data files are provided for each broad research area and contain variables capturing scientists' offline and online activity. We used these measures to evaluate and model the online success of scholars. Broad research areas were inferred from Web of Science data provided by Clarivate Analytics, available for cost from at https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/. In addition, affiliates of member institutions can access Web of Science data for free through CADRE at: https://cadre.iu.edu/about-cadre. The algorithm used for classifying broad research areas is accessible at: https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/1/183/15573/Practical-method-to-reclassify-Web-of-Science, Figure 2.

 
The number of online shares of scientists' articles was obtained through Altmetric's free Researcher Data Access Program (https://www.altmetric.com/research-access/). Metrics of scientists' ego networks were collected from the Open Academic Graph dataset which is available here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/open-academic-graph/.
