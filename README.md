# DATABASE DESCRIPTION

Folder contains the final database used in manuscripts "O. Vásárhelyi, I Zakhlebin, S. Milojevic, EÁ. Horvát: Gender inequities in the online dissemination of scholars’ work"

Each dataset contains variables capturing sceintists' offline and online activity that was used to model the online success of scientists by broad research areas. Broad research areas were inferred from Web of Science data provided by by Clarivate Analytics, available for cost from at https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/.  For the assignment of subject categories you can find an algorithm (pseudocode) describing the reclassification procedure at: https://direct.mit.edu/qss/article/1/1/183/15573/Practical-method-to-reclassify-Web-of-Science.

The number of shares sceintists articles recevied in 2012 was obtained through the Altmetric's free Researcher Data Access Program (https://www.altmetric.com/research-access/). Metrics of scientists' ego networks were collected from the Open Academic Graph dataset which is available here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/open-academic-graph/.
